Welcome to pyPlotFormat's documentation!
========================================

This tool provides fast and consistent formatting to Matplotlib figures
generated in Python. It can be used to generate PDF figures of plotted data
which will be consistent with the formatting of many conference and journal 
papers. This tool also has the capability to save Matplotlib figures for 
formatting or reformatting at a later date. See Usage section for details on 
installation and usage instructions.
